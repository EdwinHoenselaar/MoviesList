# MoviesList

This project is made to practice using mongoDB. The goal is to make an app where i can keep track of the movies i own on DVD and Blu-ray (i have a lot of hardcopies).

I will be using the MERN stack for this project:
MongoDB (with mongoose as ORM)
Express
React (with redux)
Node.js

Steps:
1. Create a simple REST API with express and mongoose.
2. Connect with a MongoDB Atlas db in the cloud.
3. Create a simple client which shows the movielist.
4. Create a form to add movies to the list.
5. Create an EDIT funcionality to the list.
6. Create an DELETE funcionality to the list.

Future goals:
1. connect to imdb api.
2. find a way to get movie information by scanning the barcode.
3. do an image search on the cover and try to connect it to the list.
